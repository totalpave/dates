Note: Version 1.x is public and available on the official NPM registry.

Version 2.x depends on some private packages as we are working towards to reform
our application front-end codebases.

This library will remain public for now but will not be usable as is. If there
is interest, I'll look into the possibility of open sourcing the interfaces
package.
